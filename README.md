# Project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering
 List Pagination and Filtering

 This project uses JavaScript to take a list of student info and only displays 10 students on the page at a time. Navigation capability is added using numbered links at the bottom of the page so users can click through each page to see the other students' info.
