# LIST PAGINATION AND FILTERING
 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 2 - List Pagination and Filtering

 In this project, I used the principle of "progressive enhancement" to enhance usability of a web page displaying student entries. The page still displays the students' names even with JavaScript disabled, but it is much improved (enhanced) with the JavaScript programming I added. I have also programmed the pagination to work with a list of any number of students, so it is flexible and able to respond to lists of different lengths.

Key achievements:
- Used JavaScript to take a list of student info and only displays 10 students on the page at a time
- Added a navigation system -- using a series of links at the bottom of the page -- to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time
