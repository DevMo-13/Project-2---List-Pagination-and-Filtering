Key achievements:
- Utilized the principle of progressive enhancement to enhance usability of a web page displaying student entries
- Used JavaScript to take a list of student info and only displays 10 students on the page at a time
- Added a navigation system - using a series of links at the bottom of the page - to let users click through the other student entries, 10 at a time
- Programmed the pagination to work with a list of any number of students, so it is flexible and able to respond to lists of different lengths
